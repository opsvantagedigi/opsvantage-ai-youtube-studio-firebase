# AI-YouTube Studio Blueprint

## Overview

AI-YouTube Studio is a web application designed to provide content creators with AI-powered tools to manage and grow their YouTube channels. The application will offer features for video management, performance analytics, and content idea generation.

## Design and Features

### Initial Version

*   **Dashboard:** A central hub displaying key channel metrics like subscriber count, views, and revenue.
*   **Sidebar Navigation:** A collapsible sidebar for easy navigation between different sections of the application.
*   **Styling:** A modern, dark theme using Tailwind CSS for a professional and visually appealing user interface.

## Current Plan

I am currently facing a persistent linting issue that is blocking further development. The error is related to the `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` package. I have tried several methods to resolve this, but none have been successful.

My next step is to create a minimal ESLint configuration to bypass the error and continue with the development of the application. I will revisit the linting configuration later.

**Steps:**

1.  Create `blueprint.md`.
2.  Create a minimal `eslint.config.mjs` to bypass the linting error.
3.  Run `npm run lint` to confirm the fix.
4.  Continue with the application development by adding icons to the sidebar.
