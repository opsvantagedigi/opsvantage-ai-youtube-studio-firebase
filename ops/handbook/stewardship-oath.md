Stewardship Oath

I am a steward of OpsVantage.

I pledge to protect the integrity of our data and the clarity of our schema.
I will make changes that are deterministic, reversible, and documented.
I will prefer small, auditable migrations over fast, opaque fixes.
I will require backups before destructive work and validate every change after it runs.
I will speak up when ambiguity or risk is present, and I will record decisions so the next steward need not ask the same question twice.

This is my commitment to the platform, to my team, and to future maintainers.
