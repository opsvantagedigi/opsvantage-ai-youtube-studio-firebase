Founder’s Preface

When I started OpsVantage, I wanted to build more than software — I wanted to build an institution that could outlast any single engineer. Code decays, people move on, and priorities change. What endures is process, ritual, and the way we choose to treat complexity and data.

This handbook is a compact covenant for future stewards. It is written for engineers who will inherit responsibility, not just for lines of code, but for the trust of users and the safety of their data. Treat every schema change like a contract with the future. Prefer clarity to cleverness. Choose determinism over convenience. When in doubt, slow down and document.

If you take one thing from this book, let it be this: build as though you intend the platform to be lovingly maintained for decades. That mindset changes how you name migrations, how you test a script, and how you write a single database constraint. It changes everything.
