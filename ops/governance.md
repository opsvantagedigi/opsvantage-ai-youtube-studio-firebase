# Governance
This document describes branching and approval policies for OpsVantage.

Branching policy
- Use short-lived feature branches: `feature/…`, `fix/…`, `chore/…`.
- Open PRs against `main` and include a short description and tests where relevant.

Approvals
- Any change to `docs/`, `ops/`, or CI workflows requires at least one maintainer approval and one steward (founder/admin) approval.

Documentation cadence
- Doc owners must update relevant docs when changing billing, auth, or critical routes.
